      <p id="main-content">Kayla is transitioning into STEAM from a non-tech field. <br> <br>
        She wants to build and innovate, she just doesn't know what yet.<br><br>
        She's still thinking about what her site will be about. <br> <br> It could be a mood board... look like a collage... a page where she manifests her dreams... <br> <br>
        For now she's decided this will be her personal junk drawer and corner of the internet</p>
